# Tempora Facta Casa

A puzzle game for the course Interaktive Visualisierung. Interdisciplinary work between Architects and Games Engineers.

The year is 2040 and this year sees the "Tempora Facta Casa" architecture competition, the largest of its kind in Europe. It brings together the best architecture students in Europe, including you, the player. 

Ten years ago, in 2030, the best architects in Europe took part in a competition to create a wide variety of buildings made of wood. These buildings have since been exposed to wind and weather, which is why the facades have weathered in various ways. In the "Tempora Facta Casa" competition, the aim is to collect various clues on the site where the buildings were placed. To find all the clues, however, you also have to travel back in time - because some notes can only be found in the past, others only in the present. This forces the player to look at the buildings with and without weathering. The clues describe the characteristics of the wooden fa√ßades and their ageing process, the architects and their style, as well as the locations of other clues. These clues must be used to match the architects with their buildings in order to win the competition.
