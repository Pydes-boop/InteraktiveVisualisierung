Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the European architecture contest - "Tempora facta casa"!
It is the first one of its kind, and thus, this is a very special moment for all of us!
We gathered Europe's best architecture students in order to compete against each other today!
Who will be able to figure out the riddles first?
Ten years ago, architects from all across the continent were competing for the title of...
EUROPE'S BEST WOOD ARCHITECT!
Now, in 2040, we can finally see the final version of those marvellous buildings!
How did the buildings do? Which ones stood the test of time?
And even more important: Can the students figure out the purpose of each house and the ideas behind their designs?
Let's find out! Our first contestant, please enter the arena!
