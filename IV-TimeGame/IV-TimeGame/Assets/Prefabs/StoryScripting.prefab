  - "Welcome to the architecture contest \"Tempora facta casa\"! \n"
  - 'In front of you is a pinboard, on which you need to assign every house to its
    respective creator. All the architects on this pinboard participated in the biggest
    architecture contest of Europe 10 years ago, in 2030.

    In order to find out
    which architect designed which house, you will need to collect notes that are
    spread over the entire area. On each note, you will find a hint for the next
    note.'
  - 'The hints on the notes will describe various aspects of the buildings - such
    as the usage, the facade, and the aging process.

    Furthermore, the notes
    will not only be distributed across space- but also time.'
  - Every participant of this contest receives a time travelling watch, with which
    one can travel across time. This is important, since there is no guarantee, that
    a piece of paper stays at the same spot for ten years - or that it even existed
    ten years ago.
  - ' So, have fun exploring the area! The first note is hidden close to your spawning
    point :).'
